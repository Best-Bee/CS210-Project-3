Summary of project and experiences involved: 

  This project was to build a user interface allowing to allow a user to request data in regards to the stock of items in a store. 
  The user may request data in the form of a single item's count, the count of all items in numerical form, and the count of all items in the form of a histogram.

  I created the code so that it follows all the requirements stated, while some features were left out, those features were not required based on the project specifications.

  I could enhance my code by adding more QOL and options to it, such as ignoring case (make Apple and apple the same), or allow the user to input their own data file based on the path name.
  
  This would make it much easier to view different sections of a store or smaller portions as the user could view just one area based on the input file rather than one input file whose name or data must be
    changed internally each time the user wants to change the data they are viewing.

  The hardest part of this was getting the input file to actually read and store the data properly, while it did read initially, none of the data was actually inputted so that took a bit to solve but other 
    than that, not much stood out in terms of difficulty.

  I could use the ability to read from input files for other projects of almost any kind, especially projects that involve saving and loading data.

  I made this program as such by making functions that could be transfered to other projects, making my functions do individual tasks, and commenting nearly everything in my code so that anyone, even those
    without coding experience could get a basic understanding of what each segment of code does and where it does it (as such it is easy to maintain, adapt to other situations, and read).
